## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-time Accident Detection**: Uses a tilt sensor to detect collision or rollover. Triggers automatic SMS alerts with GPS location.
- **Emergency Ventilation**: Activates a DC motor to simulate automatic window opening post-accident.
- **Alcohol Detection**: Checks driver sobriety using a digital sensor. Sends alert if alcohol is detected.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Activates a cooling fan when the internal temperature exceeds 40Â°C.
- **Battery Health Monitoring**: Displays real-time battery percentage using voltage and current sensors.

## ðŸ“Š System Workflow

1. **Startup**: System initializes and displays status on the LCD.
2. **Accident Detection**: Tilt sensor triggers GPS and GSM modules to send alert with location.
3. **Post-Accident Response**: Relay activates motor for 5 seconds to simulate window opening.
4. **Alcohol Check**: If alcohol is detected, alert is sent via SMS and shown on LCD.
5. **Temperature Monitoring**: Fan turns on if temperature > 40Â°C.
6. **Battery Monitoring**: Voltage is mapped to percentage and displayed on LCD.
